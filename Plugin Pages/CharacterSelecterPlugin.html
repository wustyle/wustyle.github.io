				<h3>Character Selector Plugin</h3>
				<br>
				<b>Character Selector was made some time ago for one of my games. It was designed to be an auto resizable rotating character selection like one might see in FFT WOTL in the jobs menu.</b>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					While making one of my dream games 'Peasant' I realised the job selection that brought me back to my childhood was FFT WOTL and it was the most fulfilling to add. Luckily it was easy to build at the time only take a couple days!
				</p>

				<b>Plans for the future</b>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>
					I've worked on a lot of projects and my expertise seems to lie in programming and project management. I've seen a lot of bad code and great ideas that work but don't scale or integrate with large projects. I want to refactor this plugin to make it scalable by adding filters ( imagine selecting league or smite characters and their filters), add networking for p2p and dedicated servers, make everything modular. The standard for modularity is incredibly high, I won't be free to refactor for the needs of every studio that buys this and I know how picky studio leads and creative directors can be when any function wasn't designed to do. That's why every input or output will be redesigned to be modular and some I/O's may have a variety of versions for single, or multiplayer options.
