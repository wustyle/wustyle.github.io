				<h3>Orbital Component</h3>
				<br>
				<b>Orbital Component spawns and manages auto resizeable arrays of actors. It's useful for abilities with telekinetic type powers and planetary motion systems.</b>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Inspired by a story from wuxia world, the protagonist Quing Shui's family martial art spawned blue lotus' that they could telekinetically move with their mind. They moved these around to block or attack in physical space. I wanted to design it so the player could co-ordinate attack patterns like macros and have them play out with a single button click. Later on as Qing Shui's blood evolved through the ancient strengthening technique, his lotus became golden.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<b>Plans for the future</b>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>
					I want to add in the macros I mentioned above.
				</p>
				<p>
					The functionality for orbitting actors to all fly towards an enemy, selected or nearest or some other condition selected by the player or dev.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to add ai to some actors so they can automatically defend or attack by casting.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to add interactions between the player and actors.
				</p>
