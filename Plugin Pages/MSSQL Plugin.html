				<h3>MSSQL Plugin</h3>
				<br>
				<b>As the name suggests, it's a plugin that allows the connection between a MSSQL database server and an UE project</b>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					When I first made this plugins such as this one were scarce. I had some experience with MSSQL and other databases and wanted to make it easier for developpers to integrate inventory systems and character/player databases all together.
				</p>

				</div>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Plans for the future</h3>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>I want to seperate some of the systems within this into other plugins that would be even more useful to many C++ devs pke myself. Including a simple Unreal string converter, which would convert all char array, C++ and CÂ£ strings and other data types into FTEXT and FSTRINGs and vice versa. </p>
				<br>
				<p>I also want to refactor the UE functions to make them even more user friendly</p>
				<br>
				<p>Democratize the code as code plugins</p>
				<br>
				<p>Lastly, I want to repackage for various engine builds 5.0-5.5 at least</p>
