				<h3>About me</h3>
				<br>
				<b>I Have have a preference for a good story over graphics</b>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>
					The first video games I could call my own were FF XII and Prince of persia the two thrones; both of which I got with the same PS2 for either Christmas ( probably Christmas) or my Birthday when I was arount 10 or 11. I was hooked on the story on Prince of Persia and a bit too young/dumb to understand the story in FF XII at the time. FF XII however, I have replayed even more times than Prince of persia as after I came to understand the story I was hooked! I've wanted to create a video game ever since that tells a story completely dreamt up by me :)
